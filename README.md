This is an alternative vtx MCU firmware for Betafpv Lite Brushed V2 flight controller board. The factory one was about 50 MHz ahead of a set frequency so I made this. I heard that newer batches of the board don't have this issue. In this case you don't need this repo. This repo contains only source code, binaries are here https://github.com/vodka-bears/BetterLiteV2.
