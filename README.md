This is an alternative vtx MCU firmware for Betafpv Lite Brushed V2 flight controller board. Some branches of the FC have a hardware issue that cause the VTX frequency to be 50 MHz ahead of a set frequency. **Only in this case you need a firmware from this repo!** This repo contains only source code, binaries are here https://github.com/vodka-bears/BetterLiteV2.
